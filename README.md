Whoa, sooo just walked out of Plankton: The Movie and my brain is still all gooey like melted butter, which is everywhere, btw. First off, the theater was way too noisy but man, was it worth it! It's like if David Attenborough decided to mix with Pixar but then had a weird dream after eating some sketchy seafood. Plankton, lil' guys of the universe, properly spine-tingling scenes like the one with the predatory shrimp. I swear, it was larger than life, almost parallel universe chew-your-fingernails stuff. And the colors, who even knew green was such a mystical trip?!

> Popcorn crumbs clinging to my sweatpants, creating a constellation of snacks, bent under the weight of a wild cinematographic ride. The backache's real but does it matter when Plankton's voiceover explains life? Felt it vibrating in my spine, like echoes of an old childhood show theme tune that gets stuck in your head at 3 AM, except more philosophic, surprisingly poignant. 

Wasn't there that strange guitar solo bit? Electric eels jamming? I lost track or maybe hallucinated? Anyway, 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , I tell you, for real.

The plot, sure, was kinda like trying to follow a crab on a sugar high, zigzagging with pauses for existential crises. Plankton just wants what we all want, I guess? Destiny? Aquarium pipes? Ever wriggled through tubes of doom? That one chase scene made my heart leap out my chest like proverbial frogs, fro-files, fronticles, what am I even saying? 

Thinking back to last week's horoscope—did it predict I'd be contemplating sea currents in this cinematic weirdness? Life and stars align like mismatched socks, it's all aligned chaotically beautifully. Fantastical currents full of microscopic hitchhikers singing sea shanties, or maybe an ad for brain exercise.

There's something profound hidden in the dialogue. Baleen whale philosophies that are probably quoted on posters by Tuesday. What's time even mean? Just a plankton's pulse, say the crabs. But now, I’m rambling...

int[] bubbles = {7, 13, 42}; float ocean = new System.NotImplementedException(); plankton.RenderLife(ocean, bubbles);

I'm out. Walking home with the sound of plankton harmonies in my ears. 🎬🐠
